/*The program must accept an integer N as the input.The program must print the squares of natural numbers from 1.The squares must be printed upto the cube of N in the fist
line.The second line must contain the sum of these squares

Boundary conditions : 1<=N<=50

Input : 5

Output: 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121
        506
 
Explanation : The value of N is 5
              The squares must be printed up to the cube of 5 is 125
              so the values are 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121 are printed 
              the sum of these squares is 506 */
