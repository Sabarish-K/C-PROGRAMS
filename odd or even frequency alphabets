the program must accept a string s as the input. the program must print the alphabets in the string s which have occured odd number of times in the alphabetical order.
then the program must print the alphabets in the string s which have occured even number of times in the reversed alphabets order

input:
bananaleaf

output:
beflna

explanation:
The aphabet b has occurred 1 time
The aphabet a has occurred 4 times
The aphabet n has occurred 2 times
The aphabet l has occurred 1 time
The aphabet e has occurred 1 time
The aphabet f has occurred 1 time
the alphabets b l e f have occured odd number of times.so they are printed in alphabetical order as belf
the alphabets a n have occured even number of times.so they are printed in alphabetical order as na

program:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
char s[10000];
scanf("%s",&s);
int a[124]={0};
for(int i=0;i<strlen(s);i++){
    a[s[i]]++;
}
for(int i=96;i<123;i++){
    if(a[i]>0&&a[i]%2!=0){
        printf("%c",i);
    }
}
for(int i=123;i>96;i--){
    if(a[i]>0&&a[i]%2==0){
        printf("%c",i);
    }
}
}
